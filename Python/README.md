## Syllabus

### Concepts

1. What can you do with Python
    - Create scripts to automate tasks for you. (e.g. move your documents to another folder, change the names of your files)
    - Develop web applications
    - Manage your budget table sheets (Excel, etc.) in batch and create a summary for analysis
    - Create AI models
2. Common program structure of a Python


   
4. How to run a Python program

   Usually a Python script has a name, for example, 'demo.py' with a filename extension ``.py``.
   
   Generally we execute the Python script by a command below in terminal or Command Line
   ``` Python demo.py```
   
   The ``Python`` in command tells the device to run the script using a Python intepreter.

   What you write in it will directly execute once you run this command.

   Also, you can use an online editor where a thrid-party (Google Colab, etc.) provides for you and most of the time you don't worry about the environment, and it is convenient for beginner.
   
6. How to manage you environment
    Mac OS system has its built-in Python intepreter, which means you can directly develop Python scripts. However, a ``Virtual environment`` (Anaconda, etc.) is suggested on your own device to prevent you break your system in cases.
   
8. Data Types in Python
